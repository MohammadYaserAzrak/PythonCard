        The Pythonidae, commonly known as pythons, are a family of nonvenomous
        snakes found in Africa, Asia, and Australia. Among its members are some of
        the largest snakes in the world. Ten genera and 39 species are currently
        recognized. Being naturally non-venomous, pythons must constrict their
        prey to suffocate it prior to consumption. Pythons will typically strike
        at and bite their prey of choice to gain hold of it; they then must use
        physical strength to constrict their prey, by coiling their muscular
        bodies around the animal, effectively suffocating it before swallowing
        whole.
